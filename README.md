### *Disclaimer*

This tutorial draws heavily from https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dam0GPOAvVI&t=4255s. The code for the web-app has been mostly copied from here.

I tested the code on my current Windows 11 machine, not on macOS, therefore I don't guarantee that it will work as described on a Mac.

## 1. Learning Objective  
---

The Learning Objectives are firstly to set up Python and Visual Studio Code. Then to create a running  Flask application that demonstrates and visualizes how Flask-Login can be used. By the end of this tutorial you should have a website, mostly written with Python, where a user can login and logout. Therefore, the user needs an account. In addition, the user can save notes in a list and only the notes of the logged in user are displayed. Come back here as often as you need, it serves as a beginner tutorial. Through this happy path you will understand how Flask-Login can be implemented. So let's dive in!

To-Do:
- [ ] Setting up Python and Visual Studio Code
- [ ] Create a User Account
- [ ] Store this data in a database
- [ ] Login into the User Account and Logout 
- [ ] Associate notes with a specific user

---
## 2. Assumptions
---

I assume that you don't have Visual Studio Code installed on your computer and start from scratch. You don't need any prior knowledge about Flask-Login. 

It's best if you code while you read the tutorial, therefore you will implement a happy path while you are discovering new knowledge about Flask-Login.
